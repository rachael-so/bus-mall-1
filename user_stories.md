          Multiple roles involved:
          </h2>

            <strong>The marketing research team:</strong> As a marketing research company, I want to know which potential products individuals in focus groups are more interested in.  I want to know what items people are looking for online; and how many times they will review the same or similar item.  I would also like to know and compare the relation and percentage of times these same items were reviewed by customers, as opposed to products not reviewed (whether the same, or not).  I want to know the current and real time trend of the markets; and which market(s) are more volatile than others in their class; or separate.  I want new and increasing consumers; and I want returning consumers.

            <strong>The focus group participant (who will be using the application):</strong>As a consumer, I want to be able to shop with more ease.  I don't want a bunch of meaningless junk in my face.  I want to be able to pick what I want; and shop where and how I like.  I like for all my stuff to be delivered to me; rather than having to shop after a long day of work, coupled with errands.  I'm busy; and sometimes, I'm not shopping for what I need; but for what I want; or looking for what's new and interesting in the areas to my liking.  I take public transportation to reduce cost; but I lose time to shop.  It would be nice to have another venue other than Amazon and eBay; or some other corporate retailer, whom just gives you what they want to sell versus what I may be looking for or like.

            The developer: as a developer, I want to build app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups.  I want to be effective, concise; and simple in my approach.  I do not want to repeat myself.  I want the experience to be enjoyable for the user, with much ease; and the total resolution the marketing research team/client desires, for both, their own research (which may conduces to further research); and their hopes for the potential clientele.  My purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase; and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.  I do not want any results to be shown to users; and if the user must know the results, I do not want there to be an option for the user to select, until there have been a total of 25 selections made (in order to give the most accurate/fair data research results to the marketing team, as possible).  I have to keep the product selection process as untainted, as possible.
